# Asterius

## Who are we?
We are **Asterius**, a robotics team comprised of students from the Model High School of **[Evangeliki Scholi Smyrna](http://lyk-evsch-n-smyrn.att.sch.gr/wordpress/)** taking part in the **[CanSat in Greece](https://cansat.gr)** competition for the 7th time consecutively.

## What is this?
This is a repository which will contain the **code** for the CanSat's ground station, used amongst team members to collaborate with greater ease; it can also be used as a means to track the programming progress and edit on any device when needed.

## What is each role responsible for?
Here is the basic breakdown of each role mentioned in the table above and its respective responsibilities.

- **Electrical Engineering**: designing the CanSat's circuit boards (PCBs) as well as ensuring all circuits are functioning as intended.
- **Mechanical Engineering**: designing & 3D modelling the CanSat's outer shell and inner (non-electronic) components.
- **Programming**: creating the software code for the CanSat.
- **Telemetry**: ensuring the CanSat can send the collected data to our base through transmissions.
- **Recovery**: creating the CanSat's parachute as well as recovering it after it has completed the mission.
- **Data Analysis**: analysing the data (i.e. graphs) received by the CanSat during the mission.
- **Promotion**: promoting our project and finding potential sponsors to fund the project.
